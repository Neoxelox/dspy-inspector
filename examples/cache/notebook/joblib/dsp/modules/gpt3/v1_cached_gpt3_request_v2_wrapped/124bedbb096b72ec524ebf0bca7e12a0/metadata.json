The inaugural edition, held in 1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization. Since then, the World Cup has experienced successive expansions and format remodeling to its current 32-team final tournament preceded by a two-year qualifying process, involving over 200 teams from around the world.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00ab1950 FIFA World Cup | The 1950 FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil from 24 June to 16 July 1950, was the fourth FIFA World Cup. It was the first World Cup since 1938, the planned 1942 and 1946 competitions having been cancelled owing to World War II. It was won by Uruguay, who had won the inaugural competition in 1930, clinching the cup by beating the hosts Brazil 2\u20131 in the deciding match of the four-team final group (this was the only tournament not decided by a one-match final). It was also the first tournament where the trophy was referred to as the Jules Rimet Cup, to mark the 25th anniversary of Jules Rimet\\'s presidency of FIFA.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00ab1970 FIFA World Cup | The 1970 FIFA World Cup was the ninth FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football championship for men\\'s national teams. Held from 31 May to 21 June in Mexico, it was the first World Cup tournament staged in North America, and the first held outside Europe and South America. Teams representing 75 nations from all six populated continents entered the competition, and its qualification rounds began in May 1968. Fourteen teams qualified from this process to join host nation Mexico and defending champions England in the sixteen-team final tournament. El Salvador, Israel, and Morocco made their first appearances at the final stage, and Peru their first since 1930.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00ab1950 FIFA World Cup qualification | A total of 34 teams entered the qualification rounds of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, competing for a total of 16 spots in the final tournament. Brazil, as the hosts, and Italy, as the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 14 spots open for competition.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab1950 FIFA World Cup squads | Below are the squads for the 1950 FIFA World Cup final tournament in Brazil. This was the first World Cup where the players\\' jerseys featured back numbers (allowed in football since 1944), though no teams had fixed numbers for each player (that would only be compulsory from the next World Cup, in 1954). Thus, the players are ordered by name.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: When was the first FIFA World Cup held?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1}"}, "time": 1707662613.7323918}
