He won three consecutive ICC Umpire of the Year awards 2009, 2010 and 2011, after being nominated twice in 2005 and 2006. Aleem Dar, Marais Erasmus, Richard Kettleborough, Kumar Dharmasena and Simon Taufel were the only umpires to have received the award from its inception until 2016. Before becoming an umpire, he played first-class cricket for Allied Bank, Gujranwala Cricket Association, Lahore and Pakistan Railways as a right-handed batsman and a leg-break bowler. Since his retirement as a player, he has gained prominence as one of the leading umpires in international cricket. He was educated at Islamia College, Civil Lines, Lahore.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abRiazuddin (umpire) | Riazuddin (born 15 December 1958) is a Pakistani cricket umpire. He stood in 12 Test matches between 1990 and 2002 and 12 ODI games between 1990 and 2000. He stood as one of the on-field umpires in the final of the 2010\u201311 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abUmpire Decision Review System | The Umpire Decision Review System (abbreviated as UDRS or DRS) is a technology-based system used in the sport of cricket. The system was first introduced in Test cricket, for the sole purpose of reviewing controversial decisions made by the on-field umpires as to whether or not a batsman/batswoman had been dismissed. The system was first tested in an India v Sri Lanka match in 2008, and was officially launched by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on 24 November 2009 during the first Test match between New Zealand and Pakistan at the University Oval in Dunedin. It was first used in One Day Internationals (ODI) in January 2011, during England\\'s tour of Australia. The ICC initially made the UDRS mandatory in all international matches, but later made its use optional, so that the system would only be used if both teams agree. The ICC has agreed to continue to work on the technology and will try to incorporate its use into all ICC events.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abPakistani cricket team in England in 2006 | The Pakistani cricket team toured England in the 2006 English cricket season, following England\\'s winter tour of Pakistan where Pakistan had won a three-Test series 2\u20130 and the ODI series 4\u20131. As a result of this series, Pakistan rose two spots to be ranked second in the world Test rankings before this series, and England dropped to third after the 12 July annual update of the ICC Test Championship. The series was marred by a ball-tampering controversy on the fourth day of the Fourth Test, which culminated in Pakistan refusing to take the field after the tea interval in protest to a contentious decision by the umpires to penalise the Pakistani team for what they believed were acts of ball-tampering. This led the umpires to award the game to England, who thus won the Test series 3\u20130. In 2008, the ICC controversially declared the result of the final Test as a draw, altering the scoreline to 2\u20130; however, after criticism, not least by the MCC, this was subsequently reversed in February 2009 and the result restored as an England victory.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: Which Pakistani cricket umpire who won 3 consecutive ICC umpire of the year awards in 2009, 2010, and 2011 will be in the ICC World Twenty20?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1}"}, "time": 1707662590.819286}
