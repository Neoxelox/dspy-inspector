It was released on 18 November 2014 through Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and Columbia Records and Legacy Recordings in the United States. It is the first album to showcase Bowie\\'s entire career and includes a new composition, \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\", which was later re-recorded for his final album \"Blackstar\" (stylized as \u2605) (2016). \"Nothing Has Changed\" is notable for including songs from Bowie\\'s unreleased 2001 album \"Toy\": \"Your Turn to Drive\", previously an internet-only single, and a previously unreleased re-recorded version of \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\", both of which are found on the triple CD version of the album. The album\\'s title comes from a lyric in the song \"Sunday\" from Bowie\\'s album \"Heathen\" (2002).\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abEverything Must Change | Everything Must Change is the debut album by singer Randy Crawford released in 1976 on the Warner Bros. label. It was recorded and mixed at Hollywood Sound Recorders except \"I\\'m Easy\" and \"I\\'ve Never Been To Me\", which, along with all horns and strings, were recorded at The Hit Factory, New York City, and engineered by Kevin Herron with assistant engineer Ted Spencer. In addition \"Everything Must Change\" and \"Gonna Give Lovin\\' A Try\" were recorded live at the World Jazz Association\\'s first recorded concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles in November 1975.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abChange (Andrew Hill album) | Change is the ninth album by American jazz pianist Andrew Hill featuring performances recorded and scheduled for release in 1966 on the Blue Note label. The album was originally scheduled for issue in 1967 as BST 84233, but was held back from release until 1975, when the tracks appeared under Sam Rivers\\' name, as part of the double LP set \"Involution\", which combined them with tracks recorded under Rivers\\' leadership which would eventually see release as \"Dimensions & Extensions\". The first release under Hill\\'s name occurred in 1995 as part of the Mosaic box set \"The Complete Blue Note Andrew Hill Sessions (1963-66)\". The album features Hill\\'s quartet performing six original compositions. In 2007, two alternate takes, previously included in the Mosaic set, were added to the 2007 CD release. The first one, a shorter take of \"Violence\", was initially chosen as master track for the piece.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: \"Everything Has Changed\" is a song from an album released under which record label ?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1}"}, "time": 1707662598.6625412}
