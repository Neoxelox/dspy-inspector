His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory\\'s use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abDavid Gregory (footballer, born 1970) | Born in Polstead, Gregory began his career at Ipswich Town, making 32 appearances between 1987\u20131995. He made two appearances on loan at Hereford United and three appearances at Peterborough United after leaving Ipswich. He joined Colchester United in 1995 and spent seven years at Layer Road, making 226 league appearances and scoring 19 goals. Gregory helped the U\\'s to their first league promotion for 22 years in 1998 when he stepped up to put Colchester ahead from the spot in the Third Division playoff final. Gregory made history along with Neil as the first pair of brothers in a play-off final in the same match. His brother Neil joined the U\\'s in 1998 and played alongside David until 2000. Gregory featured regularly in the first team until he cracked a bone in his foot playing against Port Vale in March 2002 and failed to recover fitness by the summer break. He again teamed up with his brother Neil at Canvey Island in July 2002.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abDavid Gregory (historian) | David Gregory (1696\u20131767) was an English churchman and academic, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford and the first Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abGregory III, Count of Tusculum | Gregory III (died about 1108) was the son of Gregory II.
